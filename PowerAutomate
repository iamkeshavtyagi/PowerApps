✅ What is the difference between “Apply to Each” and “Do Until” actions?
Answer:

Apply to Each: Loops through a list of items and runs actions on each item.
Do Until: Runs until a condition is met (e.g., keep checking approval status until it is "Approved").
Example:

Apply to Each: Process each item in a SharePoint list.
Do Until: Keep checking an order status until it becomes "Shipped".

✅ What is the “Terminate” action in Power Automate?
Answer:
The Terminate action is used to stop a flow immediately. It can return a status like Succeeded, Failed, or Cancelled.

✅ What is the “Scope” action in Power Automate?
Answer:
The Scope action groups multiple actions together. It is useful for error handling by using "Try", "Catch", and "Finally" scopes.

✅What are “Parallel Branches” in Power Automate?
Answer:
Parallel branches allow two or more actions to run simultaneously instead of sequentially.

Example:
Send an email and create a SharePoint item at the same time.

✅ What is the “Compose” action used for?
Answer:
The Compose action is used to store, format, or transform data without creating a variable.

Example:
Use Compose to extract the year from a date:
📌 formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy')

✅ What is the difference between “Filter Array” and “Condition” action?
Answer:

Filter Array: Filters data from an array based on a condition.
Condition: Evaluates a single condition and executes different actions based on True/False.
Example:

Use Filter Array to find all orders where status = “Pending”.
Use Condition to check if an order value > $1000 and take action.

✅ What is the “Switch” action?
Answer:
The Switch action is used to evaluate a single variable and execute different actions based on its value.

Example:

If Status = Approved, send an email.
If Status = Rejected, notify HR.
If Status = Pending, wait for response.

🔟 What is the “Retry Policy” in Power Automate?
Answer:
The Retry Policy is used to automatically retry a failed action.
You can configure:
✅ Default: Retries for transient failures.
✅ Fixed Interval: Retries after a set time.
✅ Exponential Backoff: Gradually increases the retry time.

Example:
If an HTTP request fails, Power Automate can retry up to 4 times before failing.

✅ What are connectors in Power Automate? Explain the difference between standard and premium connectors.
Answer:
Connectors allow Power Automate to interact with different apps and services. There are two types:

Standard Connectors (Free) → Available with basic licenses (e.g., SharePoint, Outlook, Excel).
Premium Connectors (Paid) → Require a premium license (e.g., Dataverse, SQL Server, Salesforce).
💡 Example:

Standard: A flow that triggers when an email is received in Outlook.
Premium: A flow that retrieves data from an Azure SQL database (requires a premium license).

 ✅ How does Power Automate integrate with SharePoint, Power Apps, and Dataverse?
 Answer:
Power Automate integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365 apps:

SharePoint: Automate document approvals, notifications, and data updates.

🔹 Example: When a new item is added to a SharePoint list, send an approval email.
Power Apps: Trigger flows from an app to perform background actions like sending an email.

🔹 Example: A Power Apps button that submits a leave request and notifies the manager.
Dataverse: Retrieve, update, and delete records in a structured way.

🔹 Example: A flow that updates Dataverse records when a sales order is approved.
